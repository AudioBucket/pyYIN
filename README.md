# pyYIN
A Python implementation of the YIN Pitch Detection Algorithm as described by Alain de Cheveigne and Igor Stravinsky in this paper:

YIN, a fundamental frequency estimator for speech and music

Note: I quickly edited and uploaded this from the implementation used in our capstone project. I have not confirmed that it is bug free yet. Will do this weekend probabaly. That being said this is still a good starting place for anyone who needs a pitch detection algorithm in python.

This implementation works with WAV files and includes some neat preprocessing functions to condition the signal and improve performance.
